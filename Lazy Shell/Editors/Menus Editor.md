# MENUS
Menus that can be edited here include the game select menu, all menus in the overworld menu accessible with the X button, and all shop menus.

All exclusively menu-oriented text can be changed, as well as the music and Mario sprites used by the new game select menu.

Overworld and shop menus use a different background palette, but the same graphics and frame. Overworld and shop menus use a frame in the foreground, while the new game menu has a more elaborate foreground. So selecting a menu might change the data in the graphic & palette editors.

Right-click the images below for more options, or simply use the buttons in the toolstrip to import/export data.
