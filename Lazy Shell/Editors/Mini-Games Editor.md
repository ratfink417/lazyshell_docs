SMRPG's mini-games with a unique interface include the mine-cart levels and the beetle mania game.
   
# MINE CART TRACK-BUILDER
Here the four mine-cart levels in Moleville Mountain can be fully modified from their maps to the mushroom and coin objects that appear in them.

Two types of mine cart levels: mode 7 and side-scrolling. Mode 7 are the 1st and 3rd levels, while the side-scrolling levels are the 2nd and 4th. 

Mode 7 levels are one layer only and can be edited like a level's tilemap. The mushroom count of both is fixed at 8 mushrooms, removal/insertion is not supported. Side-scrolling levels can have a custom number of mushrooms and coins.
### Mine Cart Index
